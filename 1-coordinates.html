        Exercise: now that you've been taught about how Aframe uses a right-handed
        coordinate system (ie. negative z-index values move things away from you)
        try putting the traffic lights in the correct order:
        red at the top
        yellow in the middle
        green at the bottom

        The red light has been correctly positioned for you. Try to do this
        directly with the code, as well as with Aframe inspector.

        Note: see how there are "glitches" happening with the red light?
        This is called "z fighting". You have two objects at the exact same
        distance from the camera, so the engine isn't sure which one to put
        in front. See if you can figure out a solution to this problem.
