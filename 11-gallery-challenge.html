    Now that you have learned the basics of 3D space and geometry, A-Frame,
    and previewing VR layouts on your phone, let's practice putting it all
    together to make something.

    Brief:
    You have been contracted by a gallery to do a VR mockup of their
    next show.

    For this week, your first step will be to put together what is called a
    “grey box” treatment of the layout. Using the components you were introduced
    to, design a gallery space consisting of a floor, wall and 3 art panels
    using primitives in A-Frame.

    Don’t forget the sky! Be sure to change the colors of the floor and wall(s)
    and add 3 art pieces as textures onto the art panels. In your gallery space,
    add some seating by importing an OBJ model.

    This will be provided for you with the appropriate textures.

    And remember: put it on your face!
