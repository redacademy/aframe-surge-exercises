        Now lets take a look at rotation. Rotation is measured simply, using
        degrees. There are 360Â° in a circle, as we all know. The trickier
        part is learning to quickly pick the axis (x,y or z) that is appropriate
        for the rotation you want to do, and then also which direction positive
        and negative rotation is around that axis.

        For this, we can refer back to the right-hand rule. Point your thumb
        in the direction of the axis, and the curve of your fingers will tell
        you which direction a positive rotation is.

        But enough talk. Let's learn by doing.

        Here we have a *very roughly scaled* model of the solar system.
        With 8 planets, instead of the 9 we group up with, of course.

        Sorry Pluto.

        A couple of things don't seem to be right with this solar system though.

        First: the planets are all perfectly aligned. Try spreading their orbits
        around the sun.

        Second: Saturn's rings don't look like they are at the right angle.

        Third: how would you rotate the solar system so that we are looking
        down on it instead?

        Bonus: instead of rotating the solar system, see if you can achieve the
        same result by positioning and moving the camera.
